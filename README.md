# PRD3-Prototype
PRD3 Prototype of Shadows Over Suburbia 

9/30/24:
Tasks: 
Attack system and health system
- Winning and losing based on roles and alignment 
- Chat box 
- Announce what players were killed over night and how during day cycle
- Do something to players when they die (I want them to be able to spectate the game, so I will implement that or if that doesn't work, force them out of the game if they die so they can't interrupt it.)
- Add some options to the menu screen (I'm not sure if they'll work yet, but just adding the functionality of the buttons)
- Fix the two capsule issue if possible 
- Make sure voting works smoothy (check to see if two people have the same # of votes, it won't just crash and will either eliminate both or revote)
- Add in basics for characters (assign random character to each player and debug log what buff that gives them)
- Maybe start to implement shop, if time allows. Basic shop functions.
- What was done:
- -Fixed the 2 capsules issue.
- Tried to work on an attack system for at least 6 hours, it doesn't work. I can't get the player ID to figure out what players exist.
- Health system is there, UI is buggy right now. But it exists and every role has different health.
- Winning and losing exists, depending on what side you are on and how many players are left. This function is called after voting and during the start of the day cycle to check win cons. It will put text on the screen with winning team and then send you back to title screen. 
- Announces what players were killed over the night (for now, you can test this by killing yourself since attacks don't work.)
- Attack UI and code is there, it's just a mess. 
- If you are voted out or die, it will destroy your game object for now. I wanted it to disconnect you, but photon told me no.
